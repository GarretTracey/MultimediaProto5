    <p><B>Director Grizzly: </B> Greetings, Agents. We have a priority one
      situation: We’ve lost track of Agent X. Agent X is one of our best
      agents, and if a problem is dangerous enough that they couldn’t
      handle it, it could be a threat to the entire multiverse. Because
      Agent X uniquely exists in multiple different dimensions at once,
      locating them conventionally is impossible. You have all
      assembled a series of objects that are linked to Agent X across
      worlds, which should be enough to give us some idea of what’s
      going on. Doctor Polybius will guide you through the process.
      She’s one of our foremost experts on dimensional resonance links.
