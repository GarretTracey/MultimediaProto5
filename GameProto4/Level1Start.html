      <b>Doctor Polybius: </b> Agent X is not like most of our agents. They are
      aware of their own multidimensionality, and they are able to move between
      worlds. They don’t have control over this power; they shift when
      dimensional tides or energies carry them away, but they’ve learned to ride
      these tides like a surfer on a wave. It’s remarkable, honestly. Through
      the years, Agent X has gained a reputation as an unorthodox investigator.
      In our dimension they may be following some seemingly mundane and
      unconnected task—eating from a bowl that isn’t there, straining to hear
      sounds no one else can, or recalling memories from a life they never
      lived. Meanwhile in another reality Agent X’s counterpart braves a
      hurricane to reach the ancient library that’s home to a spell-casting
      robot chef!
