      Crucius’s machines surrounded Agent X, whirring and humming with power and
      energy. Crucius laughed, enjoying their victory. “At long last, Agent X,
      we meet face to face,” they said, pacing around the perimeter of their
      hellish machine. “You’ve foiled me time and again, turned my glorious
      schemes to rubble. But now you’ve failed, my old friend.” Agent X looked
      around, seeking any way out. “A little premature, don’t you think?” Agent
      X replied. “We both know I’ve escaped worse.” Crucius smiled. “Not this
      time, I’m afraid. This is all for you; there’s no grander plan, no worlds
      to conquer, just a thorn to remove from my side. There is no escape”
